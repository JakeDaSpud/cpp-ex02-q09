#include <iostream>

//Write a recursive function divide( int ) that will take an int argument and will
//repeatedly divide the argument by 2 (integer division), by calling divide() recursively,
//until the argument becomes less than 1. In the divide() function, output the value of the
//argument each time the function is called.

//Assume that the function divide() is called with an argument of 4. Draw a call stack with
//stack frames showing the parameter variable for all method invocations at the point
//when the terminating condition becomes true.
